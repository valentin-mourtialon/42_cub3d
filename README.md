# cub3d
cub3D is a minimalist implementation of the first-person shooter game Wolfenstein 3D, leveraging the power of raycasting techniques to generate a pseudo-3D gaming environment.


This project was inspired by the original game's groundbreaking usage of raycasting technology, which transformed the gaming landscape by creating an immersive first-person 3D experience on the 2D screens of the time.


cub3D seeks to take a deep dive into these foundational graphics rendering techniques, aiming to understand and recreate the process that brought these three-dimensional worlds to life.


In this repository, you'll find all the necessary tools and resources to get the cub3D engine running, along with a comprehensive guide on how to build your own maps and modify game parameters. As a learner, hobbyist, or an old-school game enthusiast, you're welcome to explore, modify, and expand upon this project.


Please note that this project is purely educational and is not intended for commercial use.
